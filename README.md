# FlashProject
The aim of this project is to enable people to create Flash Player projectors for Windows using Adobe's Standalone Flash Player 32.0.0.465.
This functionality was disabled by Adobe in the final versions for some reason.

But they left a loophole and this easy-to-understand windows batch script leverages just that. 
It's not the most elegant solution, but it's adequate for accomplishing our goals, preserving SWF files.

### Usage -
- You can either drag-and-drop your shockwave file onto FlashProject.cmd or launch it directly.
- It will launch into Flash Player Standalone version 10.
- Click on File > Create Projector.
- The projector will be created using Flash Player Standalone version 32.

_This repository contains unmodified Flash Player Standalone binaries - version 10.1.82.76 and 32.0.0.465_

>Notice - Adobe Flash Player has reached EOL on December 31, 2020. Meaning it hasn't received any updates since then.
There is an alternative I love, [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle).

>Please only use Adobe Flash Player as a last resort.
